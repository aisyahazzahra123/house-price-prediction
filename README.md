House Price Prediction 🏠
Machine Learning Regression Project for predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset.
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📂 Project Structure

🧹 Data Preprocessing
The dataset contained missing values in the total_bedrooms feature.
These were handled using median imputation to maintain data quality and ensure robust model performance.

📊 Model Development
Two models were implemented:

Model	RMSE (approx)	R² Score
Linear Regression	~68,000	~0.62
Random Forest	Better result	Higher
Linear Regression shows reasonable performance for an entry-level regression task, demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

📈 Data Visualization
Distribution of House Prices
The distribution of median house prices shows that most properties are concentrated in the lower to mid price range, with fewer high-value houses.
This insight helps understand the target distribution before modeling.

Optional: Scatter plots or additional feature analysis can be added to explore relationships between features and target variable.
